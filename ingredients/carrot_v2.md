## What to Look At

| What to Look At                     | Why It Matters                                        |
| :---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **(Safety)**<br><br>• Avoid cracked or split carrots<br>• Skip any with dark spots or mold<br>• Check for slimy areas    | Cracks and splits allow bacteria to enter; mold and dark spots indicate spoilage that can spread                 |
| **(Freshness)**<br><br>• Choose firm, rigid carrots<br>• Look for bright orange color<br>• Green tops should be crisp if attached<br>• Avoid bendable or rubbery carrots | Firm texture indicates freshness and longer storage life; bright color shows proper storage and maturity         |
| **(Taste)**<br><br>• Smaller carrots tend to be sweeter<br>• Uniform thickness cooks evenly<br>• Avoid oversized carrots (can be woody) | Size affects sweetness and texture; uniform carrots ensure even cooking results                   |
| **(Practical)**<br><br>• Pre-cut baby carrots save prep time<br>• Whole carrots last longer<br>• Consider intended use when choosing size | Convenience vs. longevity trade-off; different sizes work better for different cooking methods        |
| **(Aesthetic)**<br><br>• Uniform size for presentation<br>• Straight carrots easier to cut evenly<br>• Rainbow varieties for color | Visual appeal matters for raw serving; uniform cuts improve dish presentation            |

# Storing

Store carrots in the refrigerator crisper drawer for 3-4 weeks. Remove green tops immediately to prevent moisture loss. Keep in a perforated plastic bag or wrapped in damp paper towels. For longer storage, blanch and freeze for up to 12 months, or dehydrate for shelf-stable storage.

# Preparing

**Prep Steps:**
1. **Rinse thoroughly:** Wash under cold running water to remove dirt and debris.
2. **Scrub or peel:** Use a vegetable brush for organic carrots, or peel with vegetable peeler if preferred.
3. **Trim ends:** Cut off both the top and bottom tips.
4. **Cut as needed:** Slice, dice, or julienne according to recipe requirements.

**Methods Table:**

| Method              | Best Use                  | How to / Tricks                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Raw**             | Snacking, salads          | Cut into sticks, store in ice water for crispness      |
| **Roasted**         | Side dishes, caramelized  | Cut evenly, toss with oil, 425°F for 25-30 min         |
| **Steamed**         | Retaining nutrients       | Steam 8-10 minutes until tender-crisp                  |

## Tricks
* Cut carrots at an angle for more surface area and faster cooking
* Soak cut carrots in ice water for 30 minutes to maximize crispness for raw eating
* Baby carrots are actually just regular carrots cut and shaped - whole carrots are often more economical

# Details

## Carrot Varieties

Most American supermarkets carry standard orange carrots, but several varieties offer different flavors and uses. Purple carrots are sweeter with a slightly peppery finish, while white carrots are milder. Yellow carrots fall between orange and white in flavor intensity. Rainbow carrot mixes provide visual appeal but cook at different rates, so cut uniformly or separate by color when cooking.

## Nutritional Benefits

Carrots are excellent sources of beta-carotene, which converts to vitamin A for eye health. They also provide fiber, potassium, and antioxidants. The nutritional content is highest when eaten raw, but cooking actually makes some nutrients more bioavailable. Roasting and steaming preserve more nutrients than boiling.

## Frequently Asked Questions
* **Do I need to peel carrots?** Only if you prefer - the peel is edible and nutritious, but some people find it bitter or tough.
* **Why do my carrots taste bitter?** Usually indicates age or poor storage; try different brands or sources.
* **Can I eat carrot greens?** Yes, they're edible but can be slightly bitter - best used like herbs in small quantities.
* **Are baby carrots just small carrots?** No, most "baby carrots" are actually regular carrots cut and shaped into uniform pieces.
* **How can I make carrots sweeter?** Roasting caramelizes natural sugars; also, smaller carrots tend to be naturally sweeter.
