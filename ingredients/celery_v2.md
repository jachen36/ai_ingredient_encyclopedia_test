## What to Look At

| What to Look At                     | Why It Matters                                        |
| :---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **(Safety)**<br><br>• Avoid brown or black spots<br>• Skip slimy or mushy stalks<br>• Check for mold on leaves    | Dark spots and sliminess indicate bacterial growth; mold can spread to healthy parts                 |
| **(Freshness)**<br><br>• Choose firm, crisp stalks<br>• Bright green color throughout<br>• Fresh, perky leaves<br>• No wilting or bendiness | Crisp texture indicates freshness; wilting shows age and affects both flavor and storage life         |
| **(Taste)**<br><br>• Smaller, inner stalks are more tender<br>• Avoid overly thick, fibrous stalks<br>• Fresh leaves add flavor | Size affects texture and stringiness; fresher celery has better flavor and less bitterness                   |
| **(Practical)**<br><br>• Pre-cut celery saves time but spoils faster<br>• Whole bunches last longer<br>• Consider string removal needs | Convenience vs. longevity; some recipes need destringing while others don't        |
| **(Aesthetic)**<br><br>• Uniform stalk size for presentation<br>• Bright green color for visual appeal<br>• Clean, fresh leaves | Visual appeal for raw serving; uniform cuts improve presentation in dishes            |

# Storing

Store celery in the refrigerator crisper drawer for 1-2 weeks. Keep in a perforated plastic bag or wrap in aluminum foil to maintain humidity while preventing moisture buildup. For longer storage, chop and freeze for cooked dishes, or dehydrate for seasoning.

1. **Rinse thoroughly:** Wash under cold running water to remove dirt from between stalks.
2. **Trim base:** Cut off the bottom inch where stalks connect.
3. **Separate stalks:** Break apart individual stalks as needed.
4. **Remove strings:** Use a vegetable peeler or knife to remove tough strings if eating raw.
5. **Cut as needed:** Slice, dice, or leave whole according to recipe requirements.

# Details

## Understanding Celery Types

Most American stores carry Pascal celery, which has thick, light green stalks. Some specialty stores offer Chinese celery, which is more aromatic with thinner stalks and stronger flavor. Celery hearts are simply the tender inner stalks of regular celery, often sold separately for convenience but at a premium price.

## Dealing with Stringiness

Celery's fibrous strings are more pronounced in older, larger stalks. For raw preparations, remove strings by pulling them off with a knife or vegetable peeler. For cooked dishes, small pieces break down during cooking, so string removal is less critical. The strings are edible but can be unpleasant in texture.

## Frequently Asked Questions
* **Are celery leaves edible?** Yes, they're very flavorful and can be used like parsley in cooking.
* **Why does my celery taste bitter?** Usually indicates old or improperly stored celery; try a different bunch.
* **Can I eat celery raw?** Absolutely - it's excellent for snacking and salads, just remove strings if desired.
* **How do I keep celery crisp?** Store in refrigerator in plastic bag or foil, and keep cut pieces in water.
* **Can I freeze celery?** Yes, but only for cooked dishes as it loses crispness when thawed.
