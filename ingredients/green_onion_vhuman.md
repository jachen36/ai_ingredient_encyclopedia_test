| **Synonymous**     | Green Onion, scallion, spring onion                                               |
| **Taste Profile**  | Crisp, mild onion flavor. White part is sharp and green part is herbaceous.       |
| **Buy**            | Look for firm white base with clean roots, vibrant crisp green tops, fresh scent. |
| **Store (fresh)**  | Damp paper towel in perforated bag → crisper drawer (1‑2 wks).                    |
| **Extend life**    | Jar with water + loose bag (up to 3 wks) **or** freeze chopped pieces.            |
| Edible             | Discard root tip and outer skin → everything else is edible.                      |
| **Prep**           | Rinse → trim → slice/julienne/chop → use raw or cooked.                           |
| **Check spoilage** | Yellow/soft stems, sour smell, slimy texture → toss.                              |

# Buying Guide
(Purpose: Most important details when selecting the right produce and know the signs of when food spoil)

<img src="../images/Pasted image 20251004190321.png" alt="Green Onion" width="400" />

* Synonymous: green onion, scallion, spring onion  
* Confusing Names: 
	* spring onion - Same plant but slightly more mature green onion with more prominent bulb giving it slightly stronger onion flavor but still milder than fully mature onion. Often used interchangeably in name and recipes.
	* shallot - Not the similar. Sweet, mild, and complex flavor with hints of both onion and garlic.
* Other Names: table onion, salad onion, onion stick, long onion, baby onion, precious onion, wild onion, welsh onion, yard onion, gibbon, syboe (Scots), and shallot.
* Substitutions: 
	* Spring Onion - closest substitute but with slight more mature onion flavor. 
	* Allium Family - bulb onions, shallots, the whites of leaks, chives, garlic
	* Shallots - are sweeter, richer, and stronger than green onions. use less. 
	* Leaks - milder, sweeter, and less onion flavor than green onions. use the white part of the leek. 
	* Chives: Substitute as garnish. Not recommended, flavor is much more delicate and herbaceous, with a subtle hint of garlic and onion that is easily destroyed by heat.

* Refrigerate (extended storage):
	* Same as room temperature but placed in fridge. 
* **Refrigerate:** (3-4 days)
	* Place chopped onions in an airtight container with a damp paper towel on top; use within 3‑4 days.
- **Freeze:** (2-3 months) 
	- Frozen pieces retain flavor and crispness well. But the firmness is reduce after thawing. 
	- Method
		- Freeze chopped pieces on a tray, then bag.
		- Fill ice‑cube trays with chopped onions + (optional) a splash of water or oil, freeze, then pop out cubes.
			- This allows for easy portioning later
- Drying:
	- Drying green onions is another excellent way to preserve their flavor.
	- Dried green onions can be rehydrated in water or added directly to dishes like soups and stews.
	- Method
		- Chop green onions, spread on a parchment-lined baking sheet, dry in a low oven (140°F/60°C) until crisp, then store in an airtight container.
- Regrowing
	- You can regrow green onions from the root ends.
	- Method
		- Place the root ends of green onions in a container of soil on a sunny windowsill; soil provides nutrients for better growth.
		- Place the root ends of green onions in a glass of water on a sunny windowsill, changing the water every few days, and new shoots will regrow for repeated harvests.

# Preparing
(Purpose: Provide the most common ways in which a home cook would prepare the ingredient for use. And share useful and common tricks to work with the ingredients.)

1. **Rinse Thoroughly:** Hold the bunch under cool running water. Paying special attention to the area where the green and white parts meet where dirt gets trapped. 
2. **Trim the Ends:** Using a sharp knife, slice off the very bottom rooty ends (~1/4 inch). Also, trim off any wilted or dry tips from the dark green tops.
3. **Pat Dry:** (optional) Gently pat the green onions dry with a paper towel. This makes them easier and safer to chop.
4. **Slice and Prepare to Your Liking:** 
	- Chopping before storing, makes it ready to be used.

## Tricks

- Use kitchen scissors to snip green tops directly into dishes for ease.

# Waste Not
(Purpose: When you have overabundance or need to use up before going bad, here are some ideas to bulk use them up.)

* Spoilage: Play it safe and throw it away if you even question it.
* You can also refer back to the preparation section for freezing options to save them for later.

## Recipes 

* ***Green Onion Pancakes**: Mix whole or course chopped green onions into a simple batter of flour and water, then pan-fry until crispy.
* **Green Onion Dip:** Mix finely chopped green onion with sour cream, mayonnaise, salt, and pepper.
* **Green Onion Oil:** Heat oil, add chopped green onions, strain. Creates flavored oil for cooking and dressings.
* **Compound Butter:** Mix finely chopped green onions into softened butter with salt, roll in parchment, and refrigerate for a flavorful spread.
* **Green Onion Soup:** Use both white and green parts in a simple broth-based soup with potatoes or noodles for a mild onion flavor.
* **Pickled Green Onions:** Quick pickle green onions in rice vinegar, sugar, and salt for a tangy condiment that lasts weeks.
* **Green Onion Pesto:** Blend green tops with oil, garlic, nuts, and parmesan for a unique pesto variation.
* **Stir-Fry Base:** Use generous amounts of green onion as the aromatic base for any stir-fry; they cook down significantly.
* **Green Onion Kimchi:** Make a traditional Korean banchan using whole green onions in a spicy fermented sauce.
* **Dehydrate/Dry:** Chop and dry green onions in a low oven (140°F) until crisp for long-term storage as seasoning.

# Details
(Purpose: An area for more detail write up and sharing information on a specific topic. Other sections should be concise and to the point while this area will fill in the gap.)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Raw vs cooked
* When used raw, it provides a sharp, fresh, and crunchy element that can cut through rich flavors. It’s an accent, a pop of brightness.
* When cooked, its flavor mellows and sweetens significantly.
	* Added at the beginning of cooking for a milder flavor or thrown in at the end for a more pronounced crunch.

### Green Onions vs Spring Onions
* <img src="../images/Pasted image 20251002194814.png" alt="Green Onion" width="250" />

### Regrowing in soil vs water
- The water method is great for quick regrowth but soil planting is necessary for sustained, flavorful harvests.
* Growth Duration
	- **2-3 weeks maximum** without nutrients before growth slows significantly
	- Roots will develop in 3-5 days, new green shoots in 7-10 days
	- After initial regrowth, the plant will weaken without soil nutrients
- Flavor Changes
	- **Milder, less intense flavor** compared to soil-grown onions
	- Each successive harvest becomes progressively milder
	- The white bulb portion won't regenerate fully, affecting overall taste
- Growth Limitations
	- Only the green tops regrow; the white bulb gets smaller with each cut
	- **2-3 harvests maximum** before the plant is exhausted
	- Growth rate slows dramatically after first cutting
- Optimal Conditions
	- **Bright, indirect sunlight** (direct sun can overheat the water)
	- Change water every 2-3 days to prevent bacterial growth
	- Room temperature water works best
	- Cut only the green portions, leaving 1-2 inches of white base
* When to Transplant
	- Move to soil after 2 weeks for continued growth
	- Add liquid fertilizer to water if keeping in hydroponic setup
	- Plant in potting mix for long-term cultivation and stronger flavor
