## What to Look At

| What to Look At                     | Why It Matters                                        |
| :---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **(Safety)**<br><br>• Avoid green-tinged potatoes<br>• Skip potatoes with many sprouts<br>• Check for cuts or bruises    | Green areas contain solanine (toxic); sprouts indicate age and possible solanine; cuts invite bacteria                 |
| **(Freshness)**<br><br>• Choose firm, solid potatoes<br>• Smooth, tight skin<br>• No soft spots or wrinkles<br>• Minimal eye sprouting | Firm texture indicates proper storage; wrinkled skin shows moisture loss and age         |
| **(Taste)**<br><br>• Match variety to cooking method<br>• Smaller potatoes often sweeter<br>• Avoid potatoes with strong earthy smell | Different varieties have different starch contents affecting cooking results                   |
| **(Practical)**<br><br>• Uniform size cooks evenly<br>• Pre-washed saves time but may spoil faster<br>• Consider peeling needs | Size consistency improves cooking results; unwashed potatoes store longer        |
| **(Aesthetic)**<br><br>• Clean, unblemished skin for presentation<br>• Uniform size and shape<br>• Good color for variety | Visual appeal matters for dishes where skin shows; uniformity improves presentation            |

# Storing

Store potatoes in a cool (45-50°F), dark, well-ventilated place for 2-3 weeks. Avoid refrigeration as it converts starches to sugars, affecting taste and cooking. Keep away from onions, which can cause sprouting. Don't store in plastic bags. For longer storage, cook first, then freeze prepared dishes.

# Preparing

**Prep Steps:**
1. **Scrub thoroughly:** Wash under running water with a brush to remove dirt.
2. **Remove eyes and sprouts:** Cut out any dark spots, eyes, or green areas.
3. **Decide on peeling:** Peel if desired, or leave skin on for nutrition and texture.
4. **Cut as needed:** Dice, slice, or leave whole according to recipe requirements.
5. **Prevent browning:** Place cut potatoes in water if not cooking immediately.

**Methods Table:**

| Method              | Best Use                  | How to / Tricks                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Boiled**          | Mashing, salads           | Start in cold, salted water; cook until fork-tender      |
| **Roasted**         | Side dishes, crispy texture | Cut evenly, dry well, high heat (425°F+) for crispness         |
| **Fried**           | French fries, hash browns | Soak cut potatoes to remove excess starch                  |
| **Baked**           | Whole potatoes            | Pierce skin, bake at 425°F for 45-60 minutes                  |

## Tricks
* Soak cut potatoes in cold water for 30 minutes before frying to remove excess starch
* Add salt to boiling water for better-seasoned potatoes
* For fluffier mashed potatoes, use russets and don't overmix
* Pierce whole potatoes before baking to prevent bursting

# Details

## Potato Varieties and Best Uses

**Russet:** High starch, best for baking, mashing, and frying. The fluffy texture comes from high starch content.
**Red/New:** Waxy, low starch, hold shape well. Perfect for boiling, roasting, and potato salad.
**Yukon Gold:** Medium starch, all-purpose. Good for most cooking methods, excellent for mashing with skin on.
**Fingerlings:** Small, waxy varieties with unique flavors. Best roasted whole or halved to showcase their shape.

## Food Safety and Green Potatoes

Green areas on potatoes indicate solanine production, a natural toxin that develops when potatoes are exposed to light. Always cut away green areas completely, as cooking doesn't eliminate solanine. If more than 25% of the potato is green, discard it entirely. Sprouted potatoes are still safe if sprouts and eyes are completely removed.

## Frequently Asked Questions
* **Should I store potatoes in the refrigerator?** No, cold temperatures convert starches to sugars, affecting taste and frying quality.
* **Are potato skins nutritious?** Yes, they contain fiber, potassium, and other nutrients - just scrub well before eating.
* **Can I eat green potatoes?** Remove all green areas; if extensive greening, discard the entire potato.
* **Why do my potatoes turn black after cutting?** Natural oxidation; prevent by storing cut potatoes in water.
* **What's the difference between waxy and starchy potatoes?** Starchy (russets) are fluffy when cooked; waxy (reds) hold their shape and are creamier.
