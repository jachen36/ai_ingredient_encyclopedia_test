# Buying Guide
(Purpose: Most important details when selecting the right produce and know the signs of when food spoils)


![Tomatoes: ripe and unripe comparison](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Tomatoes_-_ripe_and_unripe.jpg)

**Synonymous:** Tomato, Tomate, Pomodoro, Tamatar, Lycopersicon
**Confusing Names:** Sometimes confused with tomatillo (green, husked, unrelated)
**Other Names:** Regional varieties: Roma, Cherry, Beefsteak, San Marzano
**Substitutions:** Canned tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, roasted red peppers (for some uses)

## What to Look At (REQUIRED CORE)

| What to Look At                     | Why It Matters                                        |
| :---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **(Safety)**<br><br>- No mold<br>- No soft, leaking spots<br>- No sour or fermented smell<br>- No visible damage | Mold and rot can harbor bacteria; damaged fruit spoils faster and may be unsafe |
| **(Freshness)**<br><br>- Firm but not hard<br>- Deep, even color<br>- Smooth, unblemished skin<br>- Green, healthy stem | Indicates recent harvest, best flavor, and longest shelf life |
| **(Taste)**<br><br>- Fully ripe for sweetness<br>- Choose variety for intended use (Roma for sauce, Cherry for salads)<br>- Avoid overripe (mealy texture) | Ripeness and variety affect sweetness, acidity, and texture |
| **(Practical)**<br><br>- Uniform size for even cooking<br>- Thin skin for easy peeling<br>- Seedless or low-seed for sauces | Easier prep, less waste, better results for specific recipes |
| **(Aesthetic)**<br><br>- Vibrant color<br>- Smooth, round shape<br>- No cracks or scars | Best for presentation, salads, and raw uses |

# Anatomy (OPTIONAL SECTION)
(Purpose: A deeper understanding of the parts so that one can better develop generalized knowledge on how to leverage all the edible parts without following a recipe)

*Only include this section if the ingredient has distinct parts with different uses/characteristics. Omit for simple ingredients like dried beans, rice, canned goods, etc.*

# Storing
(Purpose: Show different methods of storing ingredients for longevity. The variety of methods allows readers to apply the best approach to fit their environmental constraints.)

**FLEXIBLE FORMAT:**
- **Simple ingredients** (1-2 storage methods): Use brief paragraph format
- **Complex ingredients** (3+ storage methods): Use table + expanded explanations


| Stage                  | Method                                                                 | How Long It Lasts | Signs It's Gone Bad                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Room Temperature**   | Store unripe tomatoes stem-side down, single layer, out of sunlight    | 2-5 days (until ripe) | Wrinkling, soft spots, mold            |
| **Refrigerated**       | Ripe tomatoes in fridge crisper, in breathable container               | 3-5 days          | Mealy texture, loss of flavor, mold    |
| **Freezing**           | Wash, core, freeze whole or chopped in airtight bag/container          | 6-8 months        | Ice crystals, freezer burn, mushy      |
| **Drying**             | Slice, dry in dehydrator or low oven, store airtight                   | 6-12 months       | Discoloration, off smell, mold         |
| **Canning**            | Process in jars with acid, store in cool, dark place                   | 1-2 years         | Bulging lids, leaks, off smell         |

**Expanded explanations for each method:**
* **Room Temperature:** Best for ripening. Keep tomatoes out of direct sunlight and avoid stacking to prevent bruising. Once ripe, use promptly or refrigerate.
* **Refrigerated:** Only refrigerate fully ripe tomatoes to extend shelf life. Bring to room temp before eating for best flavor. Use within a few days.
* **Freezing:** Wash and core tomatoes, freeze whole or chopped. Thaw for sauces or soups; texture will be soft, not suitable for fresh use.
* **Drying:** Slice tomatoes evenly, dry in dehydrator or oven at low temp. Store in airtight container. Use in salads, pastas, or as snacks.
* **Canning:** Use proper canning techniques with added acid (lemon juice or vinegar). Store sealed jars in cool, dark place. Check for signs of spoilage before use.

# Preparing
(Purpose: Provide the most common ways a home cook would prepare the ingredient for use, and share useful and common tricks.)

**SCALE BASED ON COMPLEXITY:**
- **Simple ingredients**: Brief paragraph or short list
- **Complex ingredients**: Numbered steps + methods table + tricks subsection


**Prep Steps:**
1. Rinse tomatoes under cold water to remove dirt and pesticides.
2. Remove stem and core with a small knife or corer.
3. Slice, chop, or dice as needed for recipe.
4. For sauces, optionally peel by blanching in boiling water for 30 seconds, then shocking in ice water and slipping off skins.
5. Remove seeds and gel for smoother sauces or salsas, if desired.

**Methods Table:**

| Method         | Best Use                | How to / Tricks                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Raw            | Salads, sandwiches      | Slice or dice; use sharp knife for clean cuts   |
| Roasted        | Sauces, soups, sides    | Halve, drizzle with oil, roast at 400°F 20-30 min |
| Blanched       | Peeling for sauces      | Score skin, boil 30 sec, ice bath, slip off skin|
| Grilled        | Salsas, sides           | Slice thick, grill on high heat 2-3 min/side    |
| Dried          | Snacks, salads, pasta   | Slice, dry in oven/dehydrator, store airtight   |

## Tricks
* Use a serrated knife for clean cuts, especially with ripe tomatoes.
* To quickly peel, blanch and shock in ice water.
* Remove seeds for less watery salsa or sauce.
* Store cut tomatoes cut-side down on paper towel to absorb excess moisture.
* For uniform slices, use an egg slicer for small tomatoes.

# Details

## Understanding Tomato Varieties
Tomatoes come in many shapes, sizes, and colors. Heirloom varieties are prized for their unique flavors and colors, but may be less uniform and more perishable. Roma (plum) tomatoes are dense and low in seeds, ideal for sauces. Cherry and grape tomatoes are sweet, bite-sized, and perfect for salads. Beefsteak tomatoes are large, juicy, and best for slicing. Each variety has its own best use, so choose based on your recipe and taste preference.

## Nutritional Benefits
Tomatoes are rich in vitamin C, potassium, folate, and antioxidants like lycopene, which may help reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer. They are low in calories and high in water, making them hydrating and diet-friendly. Cooking tomatoes increases lycopene availability, while fresh tomatoes provide more vitamin C.

## Common Issues & Solutions
Tomatoes can become mealy if refrigerated before fully ripe. Overripe tomatoes may split or leak. To avoid watery sauces, remove seeds and gel before cooking. If tomatoes taste bland, add a pinch of salt or a splash of vinegar to enhance flavor. For best results, buy in season and use promptly.

## Frequently Asked Questions
* **Can I eat tomato skin and seeds?** Yes, both are edible, though some recipes call for removing them for texture.
* **Why do my tomatoes taste bland?** Out-of-season or refrigerated tomatoes lose flavor; buy local and let ripen at room temp.
* **Is it safe to eat tomatoes raw?** Yes, tomatoes are commonly eaten raw in salads and sandwiches.
* **How do I peel tomatoes easily?** Blanch in boiling water for 30 seconds, then transfer to ice water and slip off skins.
* **Can I freeze tomatoes?** Yes, but texture will be soft after thawing; best for cooked dishes.
* **What’s the difference between Roma and beefsteak tomatoes?** Roma are dense and ideal for sauces; beefsteak are large and juicy, best for slicing.
* **How do I store cut tomatoes?** Place cut-side down on a plate or paper towel in the fridge, use within 1-2 days.
* **Are green tomatoes safe to eat?** Yes, but they are firmer and more tart; often fried or pickled.
